Apple Pay was in preparation for a long time as Apple acquired startups, hired executives and filed patents related to payments. Apple partnered with American Express, MasterCard and Visa. Their joint project began in January 2013, though they had discussed Apple’s potential involvement for years. Their joint solution was a system where single-use digital tokens would replace the transfer of personal information. They are a payment service use for making purchases, subscribing to services and sending money. To list some of their competitors are Amazon Pay, PayPal, Google pay, and transfer wise.

Apple Pay is only compatible with the Apple operating systems which puts Apple in a position to leverage their wide customer base. Apple Pay is a digital wallet and mobile payments platform that allows users to digitize their credit and debit cards, and use them to make online and in-person payments. Apple Pay uses multiple securtiy features such as two-factor authentication and face-id to provide an additional level of security that is unachievable with physical debit and credit cards. Apple also has integrated Apple Cash as part of the Apple Pay service which allows users to send eatchother "money" via text messages. 

Apple has been able to transform themselves from a company that only made computers to one of the largest information technology companies. They did this by constantly transforming themselves and being the leader in innovation. Their creation of the iPhone paved way for the game changing innovation Apple Pay, which was able to harness the near-field technology communication that enabled contactless payments. Apple has been able to harness the technology and use it through their devises such as their watches, phones and tablets. Apple Pay’s strength over their competition is they are accepted by 85% of US merchants. They have the YOY growth users in the industry.

Apple Pay now accounts for a staggering 5% of global card transactions and that the number could hit a 10% by 2025. Apple is currently looking to implement crypto wallets into Apple Pay to allow users to hold, send, and receive crypto. As long as Apple maintians their customer base of Apple product users, they will most likely grow into one of the most dominant fintech companies around.
